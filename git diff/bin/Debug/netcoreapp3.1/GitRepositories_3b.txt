After initializing a pull request, you will see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."

Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to the existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.

Other contributors can review your proposed change, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.
